# HulkStoreRepo
HulkStoreDemoApp
This app was made as a demo to a store that have to replace an old system of accounting with a new system that allow them to manage their finance account.

Documentation.

We can access to the documentation API after we clone the project and we compile it going to the URI: https:/localhost:8080/swagger.ui-html.

There we can find all the endpoints that this API Rest expose to the users.

Another important access that we can have to keep in mind is the access to the database, that in this case is a H2 database in memory. We can access to that console in: https:/localhost:8080/h2-console.
